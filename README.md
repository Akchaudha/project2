# DevOpsStreamline

**DevOpsStreamline** is a comprehensive project aimed at enhancing the efficiency of software development and deployment processes at Abode Software. This project leverages Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD), Ansible for configuration management, and Docker for containerization. The goal is to automate and streamline the build, test, and deployment processes to ensure consistent and high-quality software releases.

## Project Overview

The project involves:

1. **Automation with Jenkins**: Implementing a Jenkins pipeline to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.
2. **Configuration Management with Ansible**: Using Ansible to install and configure necessary software on servers.
3. **Containerization with Docker**: Packaging the application with all its dependencies using Docker, enabling consistent deployment across various environments.
4. **Git Workflow**: Encouraging collaboration through a structured Git workflow with feature branches, pull requests, and code reviews.

## Benefits

- **Improved Efficiency**: Automation of build, test, and deployment processes reduces manual effort and accelerates development cycles.
- **Consistent Deployments**: Docker containerization ensures that applications run consistently across different environments.
- **Enhanced Collaboration**: A structured Git workflow promotes better collaboration among developers and ensures code quality.
- **Scalability**: The containerization strategy facilitates easy scaling and deployment of applications.

## Project Components

### 1. Jenkins Pipeline

- **Job1: Build** - Automates the building of the Docker image for the application.
- **Job2: Test** - Runs automated tests to validate the application code.
- **Job3: Prod** - Deploys the application to the production environment if the commit is made to the `master` branch.

### 2. Ansible Configuration

- **Playbook**: Installs and configures necessary software on servers, including Git, Docker, and Jenkins.

### 3. Docker Containerization

- **Dockerfile**: Defines the environment for the application, including dependencies and configurations.

### 4. Git Workflow

- **Branches**: Utilizes `master` for production-ready code and `develop` for ongoing development.
- **Pull Requests**: Encourages code reviews and collaboration before merging changes.

## Usage

1. **Setup Jenkins**:
   - Install Jenkins and necessary plugins (GitHub, Docker, Pipeline).
   - Create a Jenkins pipeline job using the provided `Jenkinsfile`.

2. **Configure Ansible**:
   - Use the Ansible playbook to install and configure Git, Docker, and Jenkins on your servers.

3. **Build Docker Image**:
   - The Jenkins pipeline will handle Docker image creation. Ensure the Dockerfile is properly defined in the repository.

4. **Run Tests**:
   - Automated tests will be executed as part of the Jenkins pipeline.

5. **Deploy to Production**:
   - If the commit is made to the `master` branch, the Jenkins pipeline will automatically deploy the application to the production environment.

6. **Collaborate Using Git**:
   - Use feature branches for development and submit pull requests for code reviews before merging into `develop` or `master`.
